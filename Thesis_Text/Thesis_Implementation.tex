\section{Option Pricing}
\label{section:Option Pricing}
The theoretical models presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:background} attempt to model the movements of real-world stock prices. With these predictions, we should be able to better replicate real option prices than if we assumed a simple constant volatility.

Currently, the two most used methods to computationally price options are known as \emph{finite differences}~\cite{Hull} and \emph{Monte Carlo}~\cite{Glasserman}.

Finite differences is an extremely fast procedure when used to price either European or American-type options, making it very appealing in these circumstances. However, when used to price other option types whose value depends on the stock prices until maturity (e.g. Asian options), the algorithm becomes very slow, rendering it almost useless.
The implementation of both Heston and SABR models (presented before) using finite differences can be found in deGraaf~\cite{deGraaf}.


With the Monte Carlo algorithm, we begin by simulating a very large number of stock price paths (e.g. 100,000 simulations). The option's payoff is then calculated for each of these simulated paths and averaged, providing a fair estimate of the option's value. This algorithm can also be easily adapted to price exotic options, making it very attractive in such cases.
In the past, simulating all the stock price paths took prohibitively long computation times and this method was often discarded for this reason. However, with the recent advancements in computer hardware and new algorithmic developments, such as GPU implementation, this method has become quite popular.
For these reasons, the Monte Carlo method will be used for the analysis of the models presented before.


\subsection{Simulating stock prices}
\label{subsection:Simulating stock prices}
As stated, to implement the Monte Carlo algorithm, one needs to simulate stock price paths. However, by analyzing eq.\eqref{GBM}, we can see that the stock prices depend on a Brownian motion process (also known as a Wiener process) which, due to its self-similarity, is not differentiable~\cite{Mikosch}. It follows that stock price paths can never be exactly simulated. Though this exact simulation is impossible, we can approximate the movement of stock price paths by discretizing the Brownian motion process in time, thus solving its self-similarity problem. The two most common discretization procedures are presented below.

\subsubsection{Euler–Maruyama discretization}
\hl{put this in background section?} One of the most well known discretization methods is known as \emph{Euler–Maruyama discretization}, and can be applied to stochastic differential equations of the type
\begin{equation}\label{SDE}
dX(t)=a(X(t))dt+b(X(t))dW(t),
\end{equation}
\noindent where $a(X(t))$ and $b(X(t))$ are some given functions of $X(t)$ and $\{W(t),\ t>0\}$ defines a one-dimensional Brownian motion process.
To apply this discretization, we begin by partitioning the simulation interval $[0,T]$ into $N$ subintervals of width $\Delta t=T/N$ and then recursively define
\begin{equation}
X_{n+1}=X_n+a(X_n)\Delta t+b(X_n)\Delta W_n,
\end{equation}
\noindent for $n=1,\ldots,N$ where $\Delta W_n=W_{t+\Delta t}-W_{t}$.
Using the known properties of Brownian motion processes, we can produce $\Delta W_n\sim \sqrt{\Delta t}Z$, where $Z\sim N(0,1)$ defines a standard normal distribution.

Applying this discretization to the Geometric Brownian motion followed by stock price paths, as seen in eq.\eqref{GBM}, we arrive at
\begin{equation}
S(t+\Delta t)=S(t)+rS(t)\Delta t+\sigma(S(t),t)S(t)\sqrt{\Delta t}Z.
\end{equation}

Due to its simplicity, the Euler–Maruyama discretization method is the most common in the simulation of stock price paths.


\subsubsection{Milstein Discretization}
For stochastic volatility models, such as Heston and SABR, where the volatility itself follows a stochastic differential equation, such as eq.\eqref{SDE}, the Euler–Maruyama discretization may not be sufficiently accurate. In these cases, we can apply the more precise Milstein method~\cite{Milstein}, defined as
\begin{equation}
X_{n+1}=X_n+a(X_n)\Delta t+b(X_n)\Delta W_n+\frac{1}{2}b(X_n)b'(X_n)((\Delta W_n)^2-\Delta t),
\end{equation}
\noindent where $b'(X_n)$ denotes the derivative of $b(X_n)$ w.r.t. $X_n$. Note that when $b'(X_n)=0$, the Milstein method collapses to the simpler Euler–Maruyama discretization.

Applying this discretization to the Heston model, we arrive at
\begin{equation}
S(t+\Delta t)=S(t)+rS(t)\Delta t+S(t)\sqrt{\nu(t)}\sqrt{\Delta t}Z_1+\frac{1}{2}\nu(t)S(t)\Delta t(Z_1^2-1),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\nu(t+\Delta t)=\nu(t)+\kappa(\overline{\nu}-\nu(t))\Delta t+\eta\sqrt{\nu(t)\Delta t}Z_2+\frac{\eta^2}{4}\Delta t(Z_2^2-1),
\end{equation}
\noindent where $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are two normal random variables with a correlation of $\rho$.


Applying the Milstein discretization to the SABR model results in
\begin{equation}
F(t+\Delta t)=F(t)+\sigma(t)F^\beta(t)\sqrt{\Delta t}Z_1+\frac{\beta}{2}\sigma^2(t)F^{2\beta-1}(t)\Delta t(Z_1^2-1),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sigma(t+\Delta t)=\sigma(t)+\nu\sigma(t)\sqrt{\Delta t}Z_2+\frac{\nu^2}{2}\sigma(t)\Delta t(Z_2^2-1),
\end{equation}
\noindent where again $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are two normal random variables with a correlation of $\rho$.

In both models we need to generate the two correlated normal variables, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, which we can generate from
\begin{equation}\label{normcorr}
\begin{split}
&Z_1\sim N(0,1);\\
&Z_2=\rho Z_1+\sqrt{1-\rho^2}Y,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $Y\sim N(0,1)$ is uncorrelated with $Z_1$.

Because it is more precise, the Milstein method will be used in the implementation of both Heston and SABR stochastic volatility models. The simpler Euler–Maruyama discretization will be assumed for both constant and Dupire's local volatility.


\subsection{Pricing options from simulations}
\hl{this should come before the discretization methods?}
To price options, we generate $M$ paths by recursively calculating $\{S_i(t),\ \ i=1,\ldots,M\}$ (or $F_i(t)$ in the case of SABR), using either of the discretization methods presented before.

When the stock price at the maturity, $S_i(T)$ (or $F_i(T)=S_i(T)$), is obtained, the option's payoff for each path is calculated from eq.\eqref{callput}. We then average all these results and discount them to the present, obtaining the (call) option's value
\begin{equation}
C(K,T)=e^{-rT}\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M\max\left(S_i(T)-K,0\right).
\end{equation}

It is important to note that, the smaller our subintervals $\Delta t$ are, the better is the approximation done when discretizing the Brownian motion process. However, by decreasing $\Delta t$ we increase the number of intervals and with it the number of calculations needed to obtain each $S_i(T)$. The compromise between computation time and precision must be handled appropriately.
 \hl{put some image here to exemplify the different time steps dt}



\iffalse
depend on a Brownian motion process, it follows that it is not differentiable. For this reason, it's impossible to exactly simulate such a process. An approximation is possible, however, using discrete jumps of length $\Delta t$ and using the Brownian motion property $W(t)\sim \sqrt{t}N(0,1)$~\cite{Mikosch}, with $N(0,1)$ being a normal distribution with 0 expected value and 1 variance.
We can then simply discretize eq. \eqref{BS} into
\begin{equation}
S(t+\Delta t)=S(t)+rS(t)\Delta t+\sqrt{\Delta t}\sigma S(t)N(0,1),
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\Delta t$ corresponds to a given time step. An example of this discretization is illustrated in \autoref{fig:GBM} with the realization of three sample paths.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{GBM.eps}
      \caption{Example of three GBM processes, using the parameters $r=\SI{0.06}{\per\year}$, $\sigma=0.05$, $S(0)=\SI{1}[\EUR]{}$ and time steps $\Delta t=10^{-3}\SI{}{\year}$.}\label{fig:GBM}
    \end{figure}
    
By simulating a large number of paths, some underlying tendencies might become apparent, which will prove useful in option pricing.


 American options, however, pose a much greater challenge.  Unlike European options, no analytic pricing model currently exists for this type of derivatives. Several numerical models have been proposed in the past in an attempt to solve this problem~\cite{Wilmott1,Hull}, such as the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm~\citep{Longstaff}, which we shall approach in later sections of the present thesis.

\section{Model Calibration}
\label{section:Model Calibration}
Both SABR and Heston stochastic volatility models contain variables that need to be calibrated in order to appropriately replicate market option prices.


Calibrating the models' parameters means finding the optimal values for these parameters such that the difference between the prices of market options and options priced under the models' assumptions is minimized. This difference should be measured with a cost function such as
\begin{equation}\label{cost}
\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^m\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{market}}(T_i,K_j)-C_{\mathrm{model}}(\theta,T_i,K_j)}{C_{\mathrm{market}}(T_i,K_j)}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
\noindent where we denote $\theta$ as the model's parameter set and $C_{\mathrm{model}}(\cdot)$ and $C_{\mathrm{market}}(\cdot)$ correspond to the model and market option prices, respectively, for maturities $T_i,(i=1,\ldots,n)$ and strikes $K_j,(j=1,\ldots,m)$.

To obtain the value of the cost function for a given set of parameters, we need to calculate $m\times n$ model option prices. We could achieve this by applying the Monte Carlo method along with the discretization procedures described before.
Because we want to calibrate the model's parameters, a large number of instances of the cost function will have to be called for our optimization algorithms to converge to an optimal solution.
Thus, it can be seen that a very great number of Monte Carlo pricers will have to be executed. Even with GPU implementation and expensive hardware, using Monte Carlo to calibrate the model's parameters will become prohibitively slow. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo method is very noisy (i.e. two Monte Carlo pricers with the same initial conditions will produce slightly different outputs), making the whole convergence even more difficult.
An algorithm that takes several hours to converge does not meet market demands.

\hl{replace "Monte Carlo" by "MC"?}

The main reason why Heston and SABR models are so popular is the fact that both of them have closed-form solutions, shown in eqs. \eqref{CH}, \eqref{sabr} and \eqref{dynsabr}, that we can use to directly price the options under each model's assumptions, without the need to run the slow Monte Carlo pricer. The optimization algorithms should then converge much faster to the optimal solution for the model's parameters.






\subsection{Optimization Algorithms}
There are several possible algorithms to find the minimum value for the cost function shown in eq.\eqref{cost}.
Our main concern when choosing the best algorithms for calibration is the nonlinearity of the cost function. This is problematic because several local minima might exist and an inappropriate algorithm may get stuck in these points, causing the globally optimal solution to not be found.

With this issue in mind, we selected two powerful algorithms known as \emph{Multi-Start}~\cite{Ugray} and \emph{CMA-ES}~\cite{Hansen2} (short for Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy), which we will summarize below. It should be noted that we will only provide a general idea of how each optimizer works. For detailed descriptions, the original sources should be consulted.

\hl{how to deal with parameter boundaries? (All these algorithms enable the use of bounds which are required for our model parameters (e.g. the correlation parameter, $\rho$, in both Heston and SABR is obviously contained between $-1$ and $1$). Furthermore, they all require an initial guess at the values of the parameters, $\theta_0$, from which they will try to converge.)}

\subsubsection{Multi-Start Optimizer}
The Multi-Start optimizer is actually a combination of multiple simpler optimizers.
The algorithm starts by generating a set of different starting points. These points can be generated at random (i.e. by sampling from a uniform distribution) or using some complex meta-heuristic such as scatter search~\cite{Ugray}.

The algorithm then applies a simple optimizer to each of these starting points, finding a (local) minimum for all of them. Examples of such simple optimizers are the \emph{Active Set Method}, \emph{Sequential Quadratic Programming}, among others. We call these optimizers simple because they are only expected to converge to the (local) optimum closest to their starting point though at a very fast rate.

After local minima are found for all the selected starting points, the point where the cost function is minimized is chosen as optimal solution.

This procedure is depicted in Algorithm \ref{MSOpt}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]\label{MSOpt}
\DontPrintSemicolon
Generate $\theta_{0,i},\ \ i=1,\ldots,N$\tcc*[r]{Multiple starting points}
 \For{$i=1,\ldots,N$}{

 }
 Optimal parameters: $\theta^{*}=\underset{\theta_i'}{\arg\min}\left\{\mathrm{Cost}(\theta_i')\right\}$\;
 \caption{Multi-Start Optimizer}
\end{algorithm}
\ 

One of the advantages of this algorithm is the fact that, because each simple algorithm execution is independent of the others (assuming no meta-heuristics are used), we can perform them in parallel, further increasing convergence speed.
As a disadvantage, we can point out the fact that, for functions with too many local minima, a large number of simple algorithm runs may be required, decreasing the calibration speed.

\subsubsection{CMA-ES Optimizer}
The CMA-ES optimizer belongs to the class of evolutionary algorithms. These methods are based on the principle of biological evolution: at each iteration of the algorithm (generation), new candidate solutions (individuals) are generated from a given random distribution (mutation) obtained using the data of the previous solutions (parents). Of these newly generated solutions (individuals), we select the ones where the cost function is minimized (with the best fitness) to generate the candidate solutions of the next iterations (become parents of the next generations) and reject the others.

As for the CMA-ES in particular, the algorithm iteratively generates a multivariate normal distribution, modifying its mean and covariance matrix at each step.

We start with a $D$-dimensional normal distribution, centered around an initial guess $\theta^{(0)}$ (obtained \textit{a priori}), with a unit covariance matrix $C$ (i.e. $C=I$, the identity matrix), where $D$ denotes the number of variables of the selected model.

We then take $M$ samples from this distribution: $\theta^{(1)}_i\ i=1,\ldots,M$, which will be our first candidate solutions. We calculate the cost function for all of these points and rank them from best to worst. We keep only the $N$ best points (i.e. with the lowest cost) and discard the others.

A new normal distribution is then created. Its mean is calculated from a weighted average of the remaining $N$ points, with each weight inversely proportional to the point's cost. The covariance matrix is also generated from the remaining weighted $N$ points. However, to produce a faster convergence, the matrices from previous iterations are used additionally, i.e. we give some weight to the matrix generated from the selected points but we grant also weight to the previous matrices, assigning more weight to the most recent.

The previous steps are repeated for a number of iterations.

\subsubsection{Polling Optimizer}
This powerful optimizer uses an adaptive mesh to find the minimum value of a function.
The algorithm starts at the provided initial guess $\theta_0=\left[\theta_{0,1},\ldots,\theta_{0,D}\right]$, where $D$ corresponds to the number of parameters. The cost function, $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta_0)$, is calculated for this point.

The algorithm then proceeds to generate $2D$ new points in the neighborhood of this initial point, where a displacement $\Delta\theta_i$ is added/subtracted to the initial point
\begin{equation}
\theta'_{i,\pm}=\theta_0\pm\left[0,\ldots,\Delta\theta_i,\ldots,0\right],\ \ \ i=1,\ldots,D,
\end{equation}
\noindent where, for simplicity, $\theta'_{i,\pm}$ denotes both $\theta'_{i,+}$ and $\theta'_{i,-}$.

The cost function is calculated for all these new points, $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta'_{i,\pm})$. If any of them have a lower cost than the original point, $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta_0)$, the point with the lowest cost function is accepted and the polling restarts i.e. we generate again $2D$ new points centered around this optimal point.

We repeat the previous step until all the $2D$ generated points present a higher cost function. When this happens, the displacement is reduced to half its value, $\Delta\theta_i/2$ and we restart the polling procedure for the optimal point found before.

The optimization stops when the cost of any of the generated points decreases past a threshold.

This method is systematized in Algorithm \ref{PolOpt}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]\label{PolOpt}
\DontPrintSemicolon
 Define $\theta=\theta_0=\left[\theta_{0,1},\ldots,\theta_{0,D}\right]$\tcc*[r]{Initial guess}
 \While{$\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)>\mathrm{Threshold}$}{
 Calculate $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)$\;
 \For{i=1,\ldots,D}{ 
 Generate $\theta_{i,\pm}=\theta\pm\left[0,\ldots,\Delta\theta_i,\ldots,0\right]$\;
 Calculate $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta_{i,\pm})$\;
 }
 \eIf{$\mathrm{Cost}(\theta_{i,\pm})<\mathrm{Cost}(\theta),\ \ \forall\theta_{i,\pm}$}
 {$\theta=\underset{\theta_{i,\pm}}{\arg\min}\left\{\mathrm{Cost}(\theta_{i,\pm})\right\}$}
 {$\Delta\theta_i=\Delta\theta_i/2$}
 }
 Optimal parameters: $\theta^{*}=\theta$\;
 \caption{Deterministic Optimizer}
\end{algorithm}
\ 



In general, most procedures require some initial guess at the parameters' optimal values, $\theta_0$. The cost function for these values, $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)$, is calculated. A new parameter vector, $\theta'$, is then generated in the neighborhood of the starting point and the cost function is recalculated, $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta')$. If the error decreases with this new vector (i.e. $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta')<\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)$), the new parameter values are assumed - otherwise they are discarded. This procedure is repeated until the cost function decreases below a threshold.
This algorithm is called deterministic because if we run the optimization twice with the same initial guess, the minima found in both instances will be the same.






%Two possible alternative optimizers exist to avoid this problem, which we will refer to as \emph{multi-start optimizer} and \emph{stochastic optimizer}.




\subsubsection{Simulated Annealing Optimizer}
As for the simulated annealing optimizer, the algorithm  starts with the initial guess, $\theta_0$, and calculates its cost function $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)$. A new vector, $theta'$, is picked in the neighborhood of the first and its cost function, $\mathrm{Cost}(\theta')$, is calculated. 
There is a chance, defined by an acceptance probability function $P(\mathrm{Cost}(\theta),\mathrm{Cost}(\theta'))$, that the new vector is accepted, even if the cost function increases.
If this chance does not occur, the algorithm remains in the same point. 

The advantage of this optimizer is the fact that if the algorithm gets stuck at a local minimum, it may be able to escape from it until, ideally, the global optimum is found. An appropriate acceptance probability function must be found for the optimization.

This method is represented in Algorithm \ref{StochOpt}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]\label{StochOpt}

 \While{$\mathrm{Cost}(\theta)>\mathrm{Threshold}$}{
