Because the stock price depends on a Brownian motion process, it follows that it is not differentiable. For this reason, it's impossible to exactly simulate such a process. An approximation is possible, however, using discrete jumps of length $\Delta t$ and using the Brownian motion property $W(t)\sim \sqrt{t}N(0,1)$~\cite{Mikosch}, with $N(0,1)$ being a normal distribution with 0 expected value and 1 variance.
We can then simply discretize eq. \eqref{BS} into
\begin{equation}
S(t+\Delta t)=S(t)+rS(t)\Delta t+\sqrt{\Delta t}\sigma S(t)N(0,1),
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\Delta t$ corresponds to a given time step. An example of this discretization is illustrated in \autoref{fig:GBM} with the realization of three sample paths.

    \end{figure}
    
By simulating a large number of paths, some underlying tendencies might become apparent, which will prove useful in option pricing.


 American options, however, pose a much greater challenge.  Unlike European options, no analytic pricing model currently exists for this type of derivatives. Several numerical models have been proposed in the past in an attempt to solve this problem~\cite{Wilmott1,Hull}, such as the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm~\citep{Longstaff}, which we shall approach in later sections of the present thesis.
