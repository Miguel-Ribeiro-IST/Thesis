\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}
Implement importance sampling - this has been done for Heston (and can easily be adapted to SABR) in \cite{Stilger}

Implement antithetic paths

we tried several algorithms but CMA and multi-start were better


use mean-reverting sabr

we could study the greeks

we could use low-discrepancy sequences in the monte carlo random number generation.

We could consider other funtions for rho and nu in the dynamic sabr...

comment that we are fitting data for an index (Nikkei) and that some models might be more appropriate for other types of data
