I would like to begin by giving a special word of appreciation to Claude Cochet for all his help in the development of this work, providing not only a crucial insider knowledge but also some truly useful advice.

I would also like to thank my two supervisors, Professor Cláudia Philippart and Professor Rui Dilão, without whom this thesis would have been unimaginable. Professor Cláudia not only introduced me to this amazing field of Mathematical Finance but also contributed with a much needed support throughout the entire development of this work. Professor Rui, being an unfathomable source of knowledge in the most varied fields, provided many valuable insights, particularly on the more technical sections, but also an important guidance.

To my friends, who accompanied me in these last 5 arduous years though difficult assignments, impossible exams, and lost hours of sleep, but also in the great times joking around and relaxing, a sincere thank you.

Finally, this work would have never been possible without the unconditional support of my family and my girlfriend. Only their confidence in me and their many sacrifices enabled me to reach this far.
